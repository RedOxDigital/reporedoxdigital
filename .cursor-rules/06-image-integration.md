# 06 - Image Integration

**TAGS**: `#creative` `#design` `#hero` `#ai`

## Simple Mandate
Every section must include real images/photos to break up text and create visual interest. For AI-generated images, prioritize faithful reproduction over creative transformation. Embrace creative freedom in layouts and interactions while preserving AI image integrity.

## Core Requirements
- **Real Images Only**: Use actual photos/images, not diagrams, icons, or animated elements
- **Professional Quality**: All images must be high-resolution and relevant to content
- **AI Image Fidelity**: For AI-generated images, maintain original composition and intent (see Rule 15)
- **Creative Treatments**: Encourage artistic treatments for non-AI elements, layouts, and compositions
- **Visual Variety**: Multiple images per section are encouraged for maximum impact
- **No Rigid Templates**: Avoid predetermined matrix selections or formulaic approaches

## Creative Approaches - Encouraged (With AI Constraints)
✅ **Full Background Images** - Dramatic, immersive experiences (maintain AI image integrity)
✅ **Split Layouts** - True 50/50 or asymmetrical image/content splits (don't alter AI images)
✅ **Multiple Strategic Images** - Grids, floating elements, or grouped arrangements (preserve AI compositions)
✅ **Minimal Typography Focus** - Clean, spacious layouts with strategic image placement
✅ **Artistic Compositions** - Creative layouts for non-AI elements, no clip-paths on AI images
✅ **Interactive Elements** - Hover effects, animations on non-image elements only

## What to Avoid
❌ **Rigid Matrix Systems** - No A1-D4 template selection
❌ **Formulaic Approaches** - Avoid predetermined "random" selections
❌ **Artificial Constraints** - Don't force variety through rules
❌ **Template Following** - Let creativity guide design decisions
❌ **AI Image Manipulation** - No creative cropping, filtering, or transformation of AI images
❌ **AI Image Obstruction** - No overlays that obscure >30% of AI image content

## Implementation Guidance
- **Start with Vision**: Begin with creative concept, not template selection
- **AI Image Analysis**: For AI images, analyze composition before implementing
- **Image First**: Build layouts around compelling imagery (preserve AI intent)
- **Organic Flow**: Let content and images guide layout decisions
- **Professional Standards**: Maintain quality while embracing creativity
- **Mobile Responsive**: Ensure all creative layouts work across devices
- **AI Image Fidelity**: Never alter AI-generated images, only enhance presentation

## Quality Standards
- **Performance**: Optimize images for fast loading
- **Accessibility**: Include proper alt text and contrast ratios
- **AI Image Fidelity**: Preserve original AI image composition and intent
- **Consistency**: Maintain visual coherence across sections
- **Impact**: Prioritize visual impact and user engagement

## The Creative Truth
**Good design emerges from:**
- Creative vision and artistic expression
- Professional image selection and treatment
- Faithful reproduction of AI-generated images
- Smart typography and spacing choices that complement images
- Strategic use of color and visual elements
- User experience and engagement focus

**NOT from:**
- Rigid template following
- Artificial variety enforcement
- Predetermined matrix selections
- Formulaic design approaches
- Creative reinterpretation of AI-generated images
