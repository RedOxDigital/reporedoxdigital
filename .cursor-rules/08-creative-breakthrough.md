- No creative positioning that alters image composition
- No layering that obscures important image elements

### 28.3 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN PATTERNS

**APPROVED CREATIVE PATTERNS (Non-Image Elements):**

üé® **Diagonal Layouts (Non-Image Elements):**
```css
/* For content containers, not AI images */
.content-diagonal {
    transform: rotate(-1deg);
    /* Note: Never apply to AI-generated images */
}
```

üé® **Floating Content Islands:**
```css
.content-island {
    position: absolute;
    transform: rotate(3deg);
    box-shadow: 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
    /* Note: Never apply to AI-generated images */
}
```

üé® **Creative Text Treatments:**
```css
.creative-text {
    writing-mode: vertical-rl;
    text-orientation: mixed;
    transform: rotate(-5deg);
}
```

üé® **Content Shapes (Non-Image Elements):**
```css
/* For decorative elements, not AI images */
.content-shape {
    clip-path: polygon(0 0, 85% 0, 100% 15%, 100% 100%, 15% 100%, 0 85%);
}
```

üé® **Layered Content Compositions:**
```css
.layered-content {
    position: relative;
    z-index: 1;
}
.layered-content::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    top: -20px;
    left: -20px;
    right: -20px;
    bottom: -20px;
    background: linear-gradient(45deg, transparent, rgba(0,0,0,0.1));
    z-index: -1;
    /* Note: Never apply layering that obscures AI images */
}
```

**AI IMAGE FIDELITY PATTERNS:**

üé® **Faithful Image Implementation:**
```css
/* AI images should use these patterns */
.ai-image {
    /* No transforms, clip-paths, or creative positioning */
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    object-fit: contain; /* or cover only if necessary for layout */
    /* Only essential overlays for text contrast */
}
```

### 28.4 CREATIVE ANIMATION ENCOURAGEMENT

**APPROVED CREATIVE ANIMATIONS (Non-Image Elements):**

‚ú® **Morphing Elements (Non-Image):**
```css
@keyframes morph {
    0% { border-radius: 50%; }
    50% { border-radius: 20%; }
    100% { border-radius: 0%; }
    /* Note: Never apply to AI-generated images */
}
```

‚ú® **Creative Hover States (Non-Image):**
```css
.creative-hover:hover {
    transform: scale(1.1) rotate(5deg);
    filter: hue-rotate(180deg);
    /* Note: Never apply to AI-generated images */
}
```

‚ú® **Scroll-Triggered Creativity (Non-Image):**
```css
.scroll-reveal {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(100px) rotate(10deg);
    transition: all 0.8s cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94);
    /* Note: Never apply to AI-generated images */
}
```

**AI IMAGE ANIMATION RESTRICTIONS:**
- No transforms on AI images
- No rotations, scaling, or morphing of AI images
- No hover effects that alter AI image appearance
- No scroll-triggered animations for AI images
- Only performance optimizations allowed (loading, fading in)

### 28.5 MAINTAINED RESTRICTIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

‚ùå **LEFT BORDER BAN** - STILL ENFORCED:
- No left accent lines or borders
- No pseudo-element left accents
- No shadow-based left lines
- This restriction remains for visual consistency

‚úÖ **QUALITY STANDARDS** - MAINTAINED:
- Professional color palette usage
- Accessible contrast ratios
- Mobile responsiveness
- Performance optimization
- Clean, semantic HTML

### 28.6 CREATIVE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

**WHEN TO BE CREATIVE:**
- Hero sections (moderate creative freedom, maintain AI image fidelity)
- Feature sections (moderate creativity, never alter AI images)
- Process sections (creative but clear, preserve AI image integrity)
- CTA sections (creative but conversion-focused, don't obscure AI images)

**CREATIVE FREEDOM LEVELS (With AI Image Constraints):**
- **Level 1**: Subtle creative touches (asymmetrical spacing, creative typography)
- **Level 2**: Moderate creativity (diagonal layouts, creative interactions on non-image elements)
- **Level 3**: High creativity (experimental layouts, artistic elements - never on AI images)
- **Level 4**: Maximum creativity (break conventions, artistic expression - never alter AI images)

**QUALITY GATES (Including AI Image Fidelity):**
- Must maintain professional appearance
- Must be mobile responsive
- Must load quickly
- Must be accessible
- Must convert effectively
- Must preserve AI image composition and intent
- Must not obscure or alter AI-generated content

### 28.7 ENCOURAGEMENT MANDATE

**BE BOLD. BE CREATIVE. MAINTAIN AI IMAGE FIDELITY.**

The goal is to create designs that:
- Surprise and delight users with creative layouts
- Stand out from generic templates
- Show genuine creative expression in non-image elements
- Maintain professional quality while preserving AI image integrity
- Drive conversions through engagement without altering AI content

**Remember:** Be creatively bold with layouts and interactions, but always preserve the integrity of AI-generated images. It's better to be faithful to the AI's vision than to creatively reinterpret it!
