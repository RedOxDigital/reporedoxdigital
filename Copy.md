1. What do we sell?

We sell a complete marketing package designed to get local customers. The package includes these specific things that all work together:

Professional photo and video shoots.

Pay-per-click (PPC) ads, primarily on Google for local searches.

Custom-built landing pages that the ads send traffic to.

An automated SMS system to text a new lead (e.g., an appointment request) within minutes.

A separate automated SMS system that asks happy clients/customers for a review.

2. Who is the customer?

Our customer is any local service business whose success depends on attracting clients from their immediate geographic area—the kind of people who search Google for "[service] near me."

This breaks down into two main groups:

A) The "You Come to Us" Businesses (Brick-and-Mortar): These are professionals with a physical location that customers visit.

Examples: Dentists, Med Spas, Chiropractors, Vets, Beauty Salons.

B) The "We Come to You" Businesses (Service Area): These are trades and services that travel to the customer's location.

Examples: Plumbers, electricians, roofers, landscapers, mobile mechanics.

Their shared mindset: They are experts in their profession but not in marketing. They are often frustrated by a lack of new clients and are losing business to local competitors who are more visible online.

3. Why should they care about our service?

Because their entire business lives or dies by attracting local customers. Generic marketing doesn't work for this. We have a system built specifically to dominate local search results and convert nearby searchers into paying customers. We cut out the complexity and focus only on the proven methods that get them booked appointments.

4. What happens if they don't buy?

They will continue to be invisible to the hundreds of potential customers searching for their services in their neighborhood every month. Their appointment book will have unpredictable gaps, and they'll keep losing high-value clients to the competitor down the street who shows up first on Google.

5. What is our single biggest differentiator?

Our specialization in local lead generation. We are not a general marketing agency. We have a singular focus on systems that turn "near me" searches into new business. This extreme focus means we are exceptionally good at it, making our process more effective for a local business than a general agency's strategy could ever be.

6. What is the main action we want them to take?

We have two primary CTAs that cater to different types of customers.

CTA #1 (The Main Offer): Apply for a Strategy Session.

Purpose: This is for the business owner who is ready to invest in a complete marketing solution. They are looking for an expert partner.

Goal: To get a highly qualified lead on the phone to discuss our full-service marketing package.

CTA #2 (The "Foot-in-the-Door" Offer): Get our $199 Photoshoot.

What it is: A 20-minute, on-site photoshoot to update their business photos (for Google Business Profile, website, social media, etc.).

Purpose: This is a low-risk, high-value introductory offer. It’s for the business owner who isn't ready for a big commitment but knows they need help. It solves an immediate, tangible problem (outdated photos) and lets them experience our quality.

Goal: To get a new paying customer, build trust, and then introduce them to our main marketing services later.
